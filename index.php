                    <h4>ABOUT ME</h4>

                    <p> As of December 2021, I completed the <i>Web Design and Development Certificate</i> program given by the School of Continuing and Professional Studies at Loyola University Chicago. I am currently working toward building more experience in web development, with a particular interest in transitioning into a Full Stack Developer.</p>
                    <p>I have a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Florida Atlantic University. I've worked in an administrative role for a Virginia based non-profit for 13 years and worked remotely since 2018. My job skills have grown along with my responsibilities. I will add more information about my skills as I build this site but, among other things, I built and manage the organization's HTML email templates. I also have Salesforce Administrative duties for the company and have written and maintain complex Salesforce formulas for email merging and record keeping. </p>


                    <p> As of late Summer 2020, I have been residing in Kansas City, KS with my husband and dog.</p>
